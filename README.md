# StanSwiftCode

This repository contains an Xcode project with multiple "Targets" for command line prograns written in Swift.

To open the project, open the file `StanSwiftTerminal.xcodeproj` in Xcode. Each "Target", such as `CookieJar` contains exactly one `main.swift` file. This is the code to be executed —— a singular entry point. The use of "Targets" affords us the ability to have multiple runnable files
