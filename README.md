#StanSwiftCode

This repository contains an Xcode project with multiple "Targets" for command line prograns written in Swift.

To open the project, open the file `StanSwiftTerminal.xcodeproj` in Xcode. Each "Target", such as `CookieJar` contains exactly one `main.swift` file. This is the code to be executed, like a Swift Playground file. Other files within the "Target" are visible to other files within the "Target" but not across all "Targets".
